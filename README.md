# Talentify

This repository contains the backend and frontend for the Talentify project.

## Starting the backend

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd Talentify-backend
npm install
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend uses `server.js` as the entry point and listens on port `5000` by default (or the value of the `PORT` environment variable).
